# Arduino Samples
A set code samples I'm writing to learn Arduino programming

##Files
### a_keyboard_0_4in_who
Keyboard test for a 4 key (direct input) sample keyboard. I use it to check if the input pins are properly set. Once I label the keyboard cables I won't need this anymore.

### b_rgb_led_0_who:
RGB led test to check which out goes to each pin, again, once I start using labels I won't need this.

###b_rgb_led_1_pulse_lcd
Changes the color of a RGB led and displays the RGB values on a LCD.
